## About me
I am **Ajay Malik**, an incoming senior at William Fremd High School. I like to ride my bike during the summer, and code in R and Python.

## About the project
This project is titled *High School Performance and Future Salary, by College*, and this project analyzes the correlation between high performance in high school and predicted future salary.

### Goals
* To learn how to make neat websites using Distill
  + Titling is a bit weird but I will figure it out
* To create easy-to-understand visualizations that are available on the web
